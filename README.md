## Design
* There is **no damage soaking** of any kind. Either an attack hits or it doesn't. Your maximum damage stays the same no
  matter what you attack.
* There are **no hardcoded item stats**. Items are given stat types which scale by item level.
* There is **no experience system**. All your power comes from items and tactics.
* **Item quality** determines the amount of effects an item has. **Similar to World of Warcraft's system**, poor quality
  items have no effect; uncommon quality items have a primary statistic (dexterity, force, or wisdom); rare items add a
  secondary statistic (anything from stamina to higher chance of critical strikes to better drops); epic items have one
  primary and two secondary statistics; and legendary items have unique abilities.
